# Objective
"As an eZ Engineer, I want...

To create a functioning, experimental combination of Symfony3, eZ Platform, and
a mix of existing elements (in YUI) and rewritten elements (in a new framework),
for the purpose of research and development (prototype), so that I can get a
better picture of how such a hybrid approach may work."
